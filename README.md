# Tracks - e-commerce site

![image](https://github.com/Soph-H-P/semester-project-2/blob/master/src/assets/site-preview.png?raw=true)

In this project I had to design and make an e-commerce site for shoes.
There is also an admin part to the site where products can be added, edited or removed.

## Description

This site had to enable users to browse and search products.

As an public user you have the ability to:

- Add items to your basket
- favourite items

As an authorized admin user you can:

- Add new items
- Edit existing items
- Delete items

Login details for an admin user:
email: admin@admin.com
password: Pass1234

## Built With

I used the following tech stack:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Strapi backend](https://strapi.io/)
